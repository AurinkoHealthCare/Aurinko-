    "paragraph1": "Getting Everyday Better With Creativity And Continuous Experimentation",
    "paragraph2": "More than 12 scientists are working continuously in our F&D, contract labs, and associated research institutes to develop, improve, and innovate the processes and technology to create niche formulations and cater to human health as well as animal wealth.",
    "paragraph3": "Process Support Center at Aurinko One Health works on process development, process optimization, pilot studies, pre-validation batches, validation of processes, transfer of technology to the plant, review improvement of processes, helps QA with investigations, and helps the regulatory team answer queries from regulatory bodies.",
    "paragraph4": "Nanophosphosome速 technology has emerged as a crucial advancement in drug delivery, research, and cosmetics. These small, spherical vesicles, composed of lipid bilayers, are designed to enhance the stability and bioavailability of encapsulated compounds. By protecting drugs or nutrients from degradation and improving their absorption, Nanophosphosome速 technology provides an innovative solution for effective therapeutic applications.",
    "paragraph5": "Neuna速 particles are extremely small and have dimensions roughly between 1-100 nanometers (nm). Nanospheres are matrix systems in which the drug is physically and uniformly dispersed. Nano capsules are systems in which the drug is confined to a cavity surrounded by a unique polymer membrane.",
    "paragraph6": "Neuna速 Min is a range of highly effective and bioavailable carbon technology-based nano minerals.",
    "paragraph7": "minerals."
